**Global Holiday Planner**

**Overview:**


This project combines data analysis, user input processing, and real-time currency conversion to offer personalized travel recommendations by creating a tool that helps users plan an international holiday based on various criteria, including population, country size, flag color preferences, and real-time exchange rates using data generated form two APIs

The first API returns data about information(such as population, sq. m, flag colour etc) of selected countries. The second API generates the current exchange rate of the selected country in comparison to 1 USD.

The 'Global Holiday Planner' empowers users to effortlessly plan their dream international getaway by seamlessly integrating real-time exchange rates. Users input their desired destination, gaining intriguing details about the country's population, size, and flag colors. As users enter their budget in USD, the project unfolds the magic by showcasing real-time exchange rates, allowing them to choose the perfect currency for a personalized international adventure.
